# snippets

This folder contains several small examples of code which could be useful for your project:

* `edges.cpp`: Gmsh example showing how to build the set of all the edges of a 2D mesh. This example is taken from the folder `share\doc\gmsh\examples\api` of Gmsh.
* `set_of_pairs.cpp`: Show the efficiency of `set<>` and `unordered_set<>` compared to a brutal search of duplicates in the edge list.

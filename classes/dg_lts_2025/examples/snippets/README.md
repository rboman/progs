# snippets

This folder contains several small examples of code which could be useful for your project:

* `edges.cpp`: Gmsh example showing how to build the set of all the edges of a 2D mesh. This example is taken from [gmsh/share/examples/api/edges.cpp](https://gitlab.onelab.info/gmsh/gmsh/-/blob/master/examples/api/edges.cpp?ref_type=heads) of Gmsh.
* `set_of_pairs.cpp`: Show the efficiency of `set<>` and `unordered_set<>` compared to a brutal search of duplicates in the edge list.

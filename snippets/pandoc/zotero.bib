	abstract = {In computational solid mechanics, the ALE formalism can be very useful to reduce the size of finite element models of continuous forming operations such as roll forming. The mesh of these ALE models is said to be quasi-Eulerian because the nodes remain almost fixed—or almost Eulerian—in the main process direction, although they are required to move in the orthogonal plane in order to follow the lateral displacements of the solid. This paper extensively presents a complete node relocation procedure dedicated to such ALE models. The discussion focusses on quadrangular and hexahedral meshes with local refinements. The main concern of this work is the preservation of the geometrical features and the shape of the free boundaries of the mesh. With this aim in view, each type of nodes (corner, edge, surface and volume) is treated sequentially with dedicated algorithms. A special care is given to highly curved 3D surfaces for which a CPU-efficient smoothing technique is proposed. This new method relies on a spline surface reconstruction, on a very fast weighted Laplacian smoother with original weights and on a robust reprojection algorithm. The overall consistency of this mesh management procedure is finally demonstrated in two numerical applications. The first one is a 2D ALE simulation of a drawbead, which provides similar results to an equivalent Lagrangian model yet is much faster. The second application is a 3D industrial ALE model of a 16-stand roll forming line. In this case, all attempts to perform the same simulation by using the Lagrangian formalism have been unsuccessful. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In this case, the recent and complex model of Marsault for the solution of the mixed lubrication regime has been implemented and tested. This model requires the use of the finite difference method to work properly. We will discuss the advantages and the difficulties encountered when trying to solve the same problem with the finite element method in a general frame. Finally, a finite element formulation for the solution of the time-dependent Reynolds’ equation coupled with the deformation of the workpiece is proposed.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian formalism is used to compute the steady state of a 3D U-shaped cold roll forming process. Compared to the Lagrangian case, this method allows to keep a refined mesh near the tools, thus allowing accurate contact prediction all along the computation with a limited number of elements. Mesh can also be kept refined in the bending zone, thus leading to accurate representation of the sheet with a limited computational time. The main problem of this kind of simulation lies in the rezoning of the nodes on the free surfaces of the sheet. A modified iterative isoparametric smoother is used to manage this geometrically complex and CPU expensive task.},

After enumerating the difficulties encountered when trying to solve the lubrication problem with the finite element method, a generalization of the formulation introduced by Liu [Simulation of Ring Rolling Process by Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian Finite Element Method, vol. 20, p. 225; ASME Winter Meeting, Dallas, Tx, 1990, Int.

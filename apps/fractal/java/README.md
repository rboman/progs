# Mandel applet

This is one of my very old java programs displaying the Mandelbrot set.

Two versions:
  * applet (only works in old browsers or through appletviewer
  * desktop application (a translation of the applet using AWT)

## applet version

javac Mandel.java
appletviewer Mandel.html
```
## desktop version
```
javac MandelApp.java
java MandelApp
```

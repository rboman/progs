This project details an example of use of CMAKE to build fortran projects dealing whith modules and submodules (dependent modules).
CMAKE doesn't support "simple" compilation of modules source files and inclusion of .mod binary files. It requires to compile the sources of mod 
files, generate subsequent .mod binaries. Then, these binaries are included in a shared library, which is convenient to link with the 
executable.
